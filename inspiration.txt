= text comes up not all at once but incrementally
= gives it some stakes
- good font
- likes that the results comes up on another screen at the end (especially when the game was tied 4-4, give it some weight and anxiety)

- like how they show you what exactly the opponent played
- says enemy instead of computer
- they changed it to wand bow mace which i didn't like, way too confusing, I will just keep it at rock paper scissors
- like the little text they added at the end of each round saying wht happened (gives stakes makes you care a bit)

- also as the typewriter effect
- can sound effects, at first I thought it was cool, but it's sort of cringy
